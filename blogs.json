DESIGN FOR MANKIND, I’ve never met Erin before in person, but she feels like such a kindred spirit. I have enjoyed tuning into her blog for years (like, so many years now!) for a dose of real-life inspiration and lovely prose. Her posts on navigating motherhood and marriage have always been some of my favorites. But I have always especially connected with her posts on slowing down, creativity, and self-care, probably because they’re always words I need to take to heart myself" ,
